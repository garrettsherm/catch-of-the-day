## Following along with Wes Bos' React Course

Course website can be found here https://reactforbeginners.com/, Wes' code for the course can be found https://github.com/wesbos/React-For-Beginners-Starter-Files.

Catch of the day is a single page web application built using React & Firebase.

Using HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter. 

## Demo

See the project deployed to now here https://cotd-nfshbnbsio.now.sh (Free hosting is slow, please be patient).

## Installation

Make sure that you have the latest stable versions of node.js and npm installed on your machine.

Clone this repo into your working directory. 

Run 'npm install' to install project. 

Sign up for Firebase. 

Change the apiKey, authDomain, and databaseURL parameters in '/src/base.js' to match your Firebase project. 

Enable Github authentication in Firebase.

Copy contents of '/security-rules.json' into the Firebase database rules.

Application will be running on localhost:3000.
